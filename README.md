# &lt;time&gt; element extensions

Formats a timestamp as a localized string or as relative text that auto-updates in the user's browser.

This allows the server to cache HTML fragments containing dates and lets the browser choose how to localize the displayed time according to the user's preferences. For example, the server may have cached the following generated markup:

```html
<time is="local-time" datetime="2014-04-01T16:30:00-08:00">
  April 1, 2014 4:30pm
</time>
```

Every user is served the same markup from the server's cache. When it reaches the browser, the custom `local-time` JavaScript localizes the element's text to:

```html
<time is="local-time" datetime="2014-04-01T16:30:00-08:00">
  1 Apr 2014 14:30
</time>
```

Dates are displayed before months, and a 24-hour clock is used, according to the user's browser settings.

If the browser's JavaScript is disabled, the default text served in the cached markup is still displayed.

## Installation

Available on [Bower](http://bower.io) as **time-elements**.

```
$ bower install time-elements
```

This component is built on the upcoming [Web Component](http://webcomponents.org/) stack. Specifically, it requires a feature called [Custom Elements](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/webcomponents/customelements/).

You'll need to use a polyfill to get this feature today. Either the [Polymer](http://www.polymer-project.org/) or [X-Tag](http://www.x-tags.org/) frameworks supply a polyfill, or you can install the standalone [CustomElements](https://github.com/webcomponents/webcomponentsjs) polyfill.

``` html
<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/webcomponentsjs/0.5.4/CustomElements.min.js"></script>
```

## Usage

This component provides three custom subtypes of the standard HTML `<time>` element. All custom time elements MUST have a `datetime` attribute set to an ISO 8601 formatted timestamp.

### relative-time

A relative time-ago-in-words description can be generated by using the `relative-time` element extension.

Tag a standard `<time>` element with an `is="relative-time"` attribute in your markup. Provide a default formatted date as the element's text content (e.g. April 1, 2014).

``` html
<time is="relative-time" datetime="2014-04-01T16:30:00-08:00">
  April 1, 2014
</time>
```

Depending on how far in the future this is being viewed, the element's text will be replaced with one of the following formats:

- just now
- 30 seconds ago
- a minute ago
- 30 minutes ago
- an hour ago
- 20 hours ago
- a day ago
- 20 days ago
- on Apr 1, 2014

So, a relative date phrase is used for up to a month and then the actual date is shown.

### time-ago

An *always* relative time-ago-in-words description can be generated by using the `time-ago` element extension. This is similar to the `relative-time` extension. However, this will never switch to displaying the date. It strictly shows relative date phrases, even after a month has passed.

``` html
<time is="time-ago" datetime="2012-04-01T16:30:00-08:00">
  April 1, 2014
</time>
```

For example, if this markup is viewed two years in the future, the element's text will read `2 years ago`.

#### Micro format

The optional `format="micro"` attribute shortens the descriptions to 1m, 1h, 1d, 1y.

``` html
<time is="time-ago" datetime="2012-04-01T16:30:00-08:00" format="micro">
  April 1, 2014
</time>
```

### local-time

This custom time extension is useful for formatting a date and time in the user's preferred locale format.

``` html
<time is="local-time" datetime="2014-04-01T16:30:00-08:00"
    month="short"
    day="numeric"
    year="numeric"
    hour="numeric"
    minute="numeric">
  April 1, 2014 4:30PM PDT
</time>
```

When this markup is viewed in a CDT timezone, it will show `Apr 1, 2014 6:30PM`. If it's viewed in a browser with European date preferences, it will read `1 Apr 2014 18:30`.
